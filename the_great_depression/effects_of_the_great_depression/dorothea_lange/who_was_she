<h2>Dorothea Lange and the Great Depression</h2>

<p>When the Great Depression hit, Dorothea felt conflicted about her career as a photographer for the elite. She felt separated from real Americans who were struggling every day. Embracing this feeling, she closed up her studio and took to the road. She photographed Americans of all walks of life, hoping to document the challenges of a severe economic depression.</p>

<p>Dorothea pursued a career that required constant motion and travel despite lifelong challenges with her leg and hip. Her disability made it difficult and painful to move around. But she often saw it as an important part of her process. She believed that many people were nicer to her because she had a visible disability. Once she gained their trust, they were more willing to allow her to photograph them in their natural state.</p>

<p>As Dorothea traveled and documented America, she met the economist Paul Taylor. Paul and Dorothea found they had much in common. They both cared deeply about Americans and worked to advocate for them through their chosen careers. Dorothea took photos of people, and Paul studied their economic habits and patterns.</p>

<p>Dorothea and Paul married in 1935. This time her marriage was one of cooperation and support. They remained married for the rest of Dorothea’s life. Paul thought Dorothea was incredibly talented. He recommended she work with him for the State Emergency Relief Administration. Paul researched the economics of agriculture, and Dorothea photographed struggling migrant workers. Dorothea’s work with Paul led to a similar job working for the Farm Security Administration.</p>

<p>Dorothea did not view her photographs as art. Rather, they were documentation of American life. Dorothea strongly believed in the ideals of American democracy, including equal rights for all citizens. She wanted her photographs to promote these ideals and demonstrate democracy’s limitations. It was not a coincidence that Dorothea captured so many different types of Americans. She intentionally photographed migrants, sharecroppers, and other marginalized Americans from varied ethnicities and races.</p>

<p>Dorothea was an optimist. Although her photographs often captured people at their lowest points, they also showed resiliency. Dorothea hoped others would see her images and sympathize with their fellow Americans who were struggling. Many of her images were published anonymously in newspapers and magazines. In many cases, the images would encourage the public to take action, raise funds, or advocate for those less fortunate in their communities.</p>

<p>In 1940, Dorothea received a prestigious grant that gave her enough money to live for one year and just create art. Dorothea invited her son Daniel Dixon and her friend Ansel Adams to photograph Mormon communities in America. As World War II escalated, though, Dorothea and Ansel put the project on hold to do something they considered more important.</p>

<p>The two colleagues were hired by the War Relocation Authority to document the experience of Japanese Americans in incarceration camps. Dorothea was opposed to incarceration policies and saw this as an opportunity to witness and document the truth.</p>

<p>She was instructed to capture all steps in the process, but she may have been too good at her job. Her photographs honestly showed the tragedy of Japanese incarceration. Parents and children were shown in horrific and heartbreaking conditions. The U.S. Army refused to share Dorothea’s photographs with a wider audience. No one saw her Japanese incarceration photographs until decades after the war.</p>
