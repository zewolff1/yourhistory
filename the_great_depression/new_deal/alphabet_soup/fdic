<h2>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (1933)</h2>

<p>
  The FDIC was created by the Banking Act of 1933 (frequently referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act). The FDIC is an independent government agency that “preserves and promotes public confidence in the U.S. financial system by insuring depositors for at least $250,000 per insured bank; by identifying, monitoring and addressing risks to the deposit insurance funds; and by limiting the effect on the economy and the financial system when a bank or thrift institution fails” [1]. FDIC is funded by insurance premiums paid by banks [2].

  Before the creation of the FDIC, bank failures were very common, especially during periodic financial crises (e.g., 1836, 1855, 1875, 1895). When banks failed, depositors regularly lost their savings, bringing personal hardship and even disaster. Between 1930 and 1933, for example, Americans lost $1.3 billion from 9,000 bank failures (about $23 billion in today’s dollars) [3]. Moreover, the threat of failure frequently caused “bank runs,” a phenomenon where large numbers of people attempt to withdraw their money from the banks; ironically, these desperate actions made banking failures more likely. Furthermore, widespread bank failure made economic crises worse. The plunge into the Great Depression was led by the collapse of around one-third of all banks in the United States [4].
