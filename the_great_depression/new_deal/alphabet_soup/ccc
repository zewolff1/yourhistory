  The CCC was primarily geared towards the employment of young men in America’s forests and parks. The CCC ‘boys’, as they were called, received training, education, shelter, health care, food, and a monthly pay of $30 – $25 of which was required to be sent home to support their families. More than 3,000,000 men were enrolled in the CCC between 1933 and 1942 [5]. This enrollment included jobless World War I veterans and the employment of Indians on reservation land. CCC boys sometimes worked alongside WPA workers, as can be seen at Prince William Forest Park in Virginia and Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland.
