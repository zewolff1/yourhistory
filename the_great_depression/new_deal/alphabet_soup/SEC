<h2>Securities Act (1933) & Securities Exchange Act (1934)
(1935)</h2>

<p>
The first Securities Act was signed into law by President Roosevelt on May 27, 1933.  At the signing, Roosevelt stated that the law was “intended to correct some of the evils which have been so glaringly revealed in the private exploitation of the public’s money” [1].

Roosevelt was referring to such things as the sale of fraudulent securities, trading on inside information, and secretive trading between small groups of investors to drive up stock prices.  Many of these Wall Street misdeeds came under the public spotlight during the 1933 Pecora Commission investigations (led by New York attorney Ferdinand Percora, Chief Counsel to the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Banking and Currency) [2].  The Securities Act of 1933 had two main objectives: “require that investors receive financial and other significant information concerning securities being offered for public sale; and prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities” [3].

New Deal policymakers understood that the Securities Act of 1933 would not be enough to reign in Wall Street wrongdoing.  Hence, they crafted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 6, 1934 [4].  The law created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and gave the SEC the power to “register, regulate, and oversee brokerage firms, transfer agents, and clearing agencies as well as the nation’s securities self regulatory organizations” (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange).  The law also gave the SEC “disciplinary powers” and the authority to “require periodic reporting of information by companies with publicly traded securities” [5].  The first chair of the SEC was Joseph Kennedy, father of future president, John Kennedy.
