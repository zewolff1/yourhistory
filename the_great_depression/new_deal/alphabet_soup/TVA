<h2>Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (1933)
</h2>

<p>
The TVA was created on May 18, 1933 by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act.  It was established as an independent agency of the federal government to further the economic development of an impoverished, mountainous region covering most of Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states.

The TVA was one of several large river basin development projects launched during the 1930s, like those on the Columbia, Missouri and Colorado Rivers.  It built dams up and down the river system for flood control and power generation, including the Norris, Wheeler, Pickwick Landing, Guntersville, Hiawassee, Chickamauga, Watts Bar, Kentucky, Cherokee, Fort Loudon, Ocoee #3, Chatuge, Nottely, Appalachia, Douglas, and Fontana dams [1].  The TVA engaged in many other activities, as well, such as malaria prevention, reforestation, forest fire suppression, erosion control, fertilizer development, agricultural education, advice to farmers and wildlife habitat protection [2].  CCC workers from nearly 200 camps in the region assisted TVA on many of these projects [3].</p>

A key purpose of TVA was to provide electricity to rural areas underserved, or even ignored, by private power companies.  It grew out of a long struggle over the hydroelectric potential at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and dovetailed with New Deal efforts to regulate private monopolies and bring electricity to the whole country [4].  It was not long before the TVA had an impact: “Across the Southeast, rates fell so sharply that residents and businesses started thinking up new ways to use electricity – a situation that had been unimaginable only a couple of years earlier, when electrical power was viewed as a luxury to be used sparingly….Ownership of electrical appliances tripled overall…By 1935 power rates were 30 percent below the national average across the region…” [5].
