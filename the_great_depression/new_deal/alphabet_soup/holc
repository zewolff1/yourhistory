<h2>Home Owners’ Loan Act (1933)</h2>

<p>
  The HOLC was authorized to make loans from June 13, 1933 through June 12, 1936. During this period, HOLC made over 1 million loans totaling about $3.1 billion – $575 million of which went to individuals [6]. The average loan size was $3,039 (about $52,000 in 2014 dollars) [7]. The HOLC ceased operations on April 30, 1951 with “a slight profit,” defying expectations that taxpayer money would inevitably be lost in such a venture [8].

  The Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933 proved to be one of the most successful policies emanating from the first 100 days of the New Deal. Not only did its program of emergency lending rescue hundreds of thousands of home owners and mortgage institutions from loss, it and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), created a year after HOLC, completely transformed the US mortgage market. It replaced the short-term mortgages and purchase contracts of the 1920s, with their high interest rates and higher risk of default, by long-term (mostly 30 year) mortgages at lower rates of interest backed by the federal government. These reforms greatly expanded home ownership in the post-World War II era, from under 50% to almost 70% of American families [9].
