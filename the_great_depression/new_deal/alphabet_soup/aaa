<h2>Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933, Reauthorized 1938)</h2>

<p>
  The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was signed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt on May 12, 1933 [1]. Among the law’s goals were limiting crop production, reducing stock numbers, and refinancing mortgages with terms more favorable to struggling farmers [2]. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration was created to implement the act, and it was initially headed by George Peek – a man, ironically, not overly enthusiastic about the New Deal [3].

  Large agricultural surpluses during the 1920s had caused prices for farm products to drop steadily from the highs of the First World War, and with the onset of the Great Depression the bottom dropped out of agricultural markets. As a consequence, millions of American farmers, tenants, and sharecroppers were left destitute and hundreds of thousands of farms were abandoned. In an effort to increase prices, New Deal policymakers sought to reduce output by destroying surpluses and taking acreage out of production [4].

  In the short run, farmers were paid to destroy crops and livestock, which led to depressing scenes of fields plowed under, corn burned as fuel, and piglets slaughtered. Nevertheless, many of the farm products removed from economic circulation were utilized in productive ways. For example: “The pork products were distributed to unemployed families…Other food products purchased for surplus removal and distribution in relief channels included butter, cheese, and flour” [5]. Even piglets too small to consume were “converted into inedible by-products such as grease and fertilizer” [6].
