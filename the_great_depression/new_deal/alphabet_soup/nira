<h2>National Industrial Recovery Act (1933)</h2>

<p>
  The National Industrial Recovery Act was a major initiative of the new Roosevelt Administration for coping with the Great Depression, designed to “encourage national industrial recovery, to foster fair competition, and to provide for the construction of certain useful public works, and for other purposes” [1]. It was signed into law by the president on June 16, 1933.

  The National Industrial Recovery Act was a two-pronged effort to stimulate economic recovery and ameliorate unemployment. Title I of the act instituted codes of fair competition for a range of basic industries and Title II created a public works program, eventually called the “Public Works Administration” (PWA). The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was established to oversee the creation of the industry codes and Hugh Johnson was appointed head administrator [2].

  The code provisions of the act were controversial because they created industrial alliances and “effectively fixed prices and wages, established production quotas, and imposed restrictions on entry of other companies into the alliances.” Participants in the code program placed Blue Eagle signs with red “N.R.A.” letters at their places of business [3].
