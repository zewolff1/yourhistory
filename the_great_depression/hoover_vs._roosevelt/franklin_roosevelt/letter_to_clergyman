<h2>Letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Clergymen</h2>

<p>
President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent this letter to clergymen around the country.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reverend and Dear Sir:</strong></p>

  <p>
    Because of the grave responsibilities of my office, I am turning to representative
    clergymen for counsel and advice—feeling confident that no group can give more
    accurate or unbiased views. I am particularly anxious that the new Social Security
    legislation just enacted, for which we have worked so long, providing for old age
    pensions, aid for crippled children, and unemployment insurance, shall be carried
    out in keeping with the high purposes with which this program was enacted.
  </p>

  <p>
    I shall deem it a favor if you will write to me about conditions in your community.
    Tell me where you feel our government can better serve our people. We can solve
    our many problems, but no one man or single group can do it—we shall have to work
    together for the common end of better spiritual and material conditions for the
    American people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Very sincerely yours,<br>
    Franklin D. Roosevelt
  </p>
