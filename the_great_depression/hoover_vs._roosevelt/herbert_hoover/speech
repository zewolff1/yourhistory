<h2>President Herbert Hoover: Statement on Unemployment Relief</h2>

<p>
On February 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover issued this statement addressing proposals
for federal funding of unemployment relief during the Great Depression.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Certain Senators have issued a public statement to the effect that unless the
    President and the House of Representatives agree to funding from the Federal
    Treasury for charitable purposes they will force an extra session of Congress.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not an issue as to whether people shall go hungry or cold in the United
    States. It is solely a question of the best method by which hunger and cold shall be
    prevented. It is a question as to whether the American people on one hand will
    maintain the spirit of charity and mutual self-help through voluntary giving and the
    responsibility of local government as distinguished on the other hand from funding
    out of the Federal Treasury for such purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    My own conviction is strongly that if we break down this sense of responsibility of
    individual generosity to individual and mutual self-help in the country in times of
    national difficulty and if we start providing federal money in this manner we have
    not only impaired something infinitely valuable in the life of the American people
    but have struck at the roots of self-government. Once this has happened it is not the
    cost of a few score millions, but we are faced with the abyss of reliance in future
    upon Government charity in some form or other. The money involved is indeed the least
    of the costs to American ideals and American institutions.
