<h2>Letter from President Herbert Hoover to Barbara McIntyre</h2>

<p>
President Herbert Hoover wrote this letter in 1931 to 10-year-old Barbara McIntyre of
Columbus, Ohio, after she wrote to him explaining that she and her friends planned to
collect old blankets, clothing, shoes, and food to send to Washington for distribution
to the poor.

  <p><strong>My dear Barbara,</strong></p>

  <p>
    I have your very sweet letter of November 10th. It is a beautiful undertaking. I
    would suggest, however, that instead of sending the contributions which you collect
    to me, that you should distribute them to those in need in your own locality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yours faithfully,<br>
    Herbert Hoover
