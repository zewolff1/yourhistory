<h2>Credit Crisis</h2>
<p>Another factor that fueled the depression was the growing gap between rich people and most Americans. By 1929, about 75% of Americans lived in poverty or on the edge of it. To pay for things, many of these families borrowed money. Farmers, consumers, and investors all borrowed money during the 1920s. Many banks suffered when these farmers, consumers, 
and investors failed to meet their loan payments. These losses in revenue forced thousands of banks across the nation to close. At that time, the government did not insure bank deposits. Therefore, if the bank closed, the depositors lost their money.</p>
