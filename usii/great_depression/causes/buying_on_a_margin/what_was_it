<h2>Buying On A Margin</h2>
<p>A stock exchange is an organized system for buying and selling shares, or blocks of investment, in corporations. By the late 1920s, stock prices were very high. The rising stock prices convinced many people to buy stocks. Many investors did not have money to buy stocks, so they borrowed the money from brokers. This was called buying stocks “on margin”. To lend money to investors, the brokers borrowed their money from banks. As long as the value of stocks continued to increase, the buyers could sell the stocks, pay off their loans, and make a profit. If stock prices fell, the investors and brokers would not make enough money to pay off the loans. </p>
<p>Fearing that this “boom market” would end, some investors began selling their stocks in late September. These sales made stock prices fall. Brokers began to demand repayment of loans, forcing investors who had bought on margin to sell their stock. </p>
<h2>Stock Market Crash</h2>
<p>Prices declined steadily until October 21st, but most experts thought there was no need to worry. Then, for three straight days, stock prices plunged as investors sold millions of shares each day. Panicked traders sold almost 13 million shares on Oct 24, a day that became known as “Black Thursday.”</p>
