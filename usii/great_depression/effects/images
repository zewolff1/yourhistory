    "This famous photograph is searing in its depiction of the utter desperation the Great Depression brought to so many and has become a symbol of the Depression. This woman was one of many migrant workers picking peas in California in the 1930s to make just enough money to survive. It was taken by photographer Dorothea Lange as she traveled with her new husband, Paul Taylor, to document the hardships of the Great Depression for the Farm Security Administration.  Lange spent five years (1935 to 1940) documenting the lives and hardships of the migrant workers, ultimately receiving the Guggenheim Fellowship for her efforts.",
    "Hot and dry weather over several years brought dust storms that devastated the Great Plains states, known as the Dust Bowl. It affected parts of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas. During the drought from 1934 to 1937, the intense dust storms, called black blizzards, caused 60% of the population to flee for a better life. Many ended up on the Pacific Coast.",
    "The drought, dust storms, and boll weevils that attacked Southern crops in the 1930s all worked together to destroy farms in the South. Outside the Dust Bowl, where farms and ranches were abandoned, other farm families had their share of woes. Farmers could not make money to feed their families or pay their mortgages without crops to sell. Many were forced to sell the land and find another way of life.",
    "In 1929, before the stock market crash that marked the beginning of the Great Depression, the unemployment rate in the United States was 3.14%. In 1933, in the depths of the Depression, 24.75% of the labor force was unemployed. Despite the significant attempts at economic recovery by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, real change only came with World War II.",
    "At the beginning of the 1930s, many living in the South were tenant farmers, known as sharecroppers. These families lived in poor conditions, working hard on the land but only receiving a meager share of the farm's profits.Sharecropping was a vicious cycle that left most families perpetually in debt and thus especially susceptible when the Great Depression struck. ",
    "Sharecroppers, even before the Great Depression, often found it difficult to earn enough money to feed their children. When the Great Depression hit, this became worse.This particular touching picture shows two young, barefoot boys whose family has been struggling to feed them. During the Great Depression, many young children got sick or even died from malnutrition. ",
    "In the South, some children of sharecroppers were able to periodically attend school but often had to walk several miles each way to get there.These schools were small, often only one-room schoolhouses with all levels and ages in one room with a single teacher. ",
    "While some men went out alone, others traveled with their entire families. With no home and no work, these families packed only what they could carry and hit the road, hoping to find somewhere to provide them with a job and a way to stay together.",
    "Those fortunate enough to have a car would pack everything they could fit inside and head west, hoping to find a job in the farms of California. This woman and child sit by their over-filled car and trailer, packed high with beds, tables, and much more.",
    "Having left their dying farms behind, these farmers are now migrants, driving up and down California searching for work. Living out of their car, this family hopes to find work to sustain them.",
    "Some migrant workers used their cars to expand their temporary shelters during the Great Depression.",
    "Temporary housing came in many different forms. This migrant worker has a simple structure, made mostly from sticks, to help protect him from the elements while sleeping.",
    "Migrant workers lived in their temporary shelters, cooking and washing there. This little girl stands by an outdoor stove, pail, and other household supplies.",
    "Collections of temporary housing structures such as these are usually called shantytowns, but during the Great Depression, they were given the nickname "Hoovervilles" after President Herbert Hoover.",
    "Large cities were not immune to the hardships and struggles of the Great Depression. Many people lost their jobs and, unable to feed themselves or their families, stood in long breadlines. These were the lucky ones, however, as the breadlines (also called soup kitchens) were run by private charities and did not have enough money or supplies to feed all of the unemployed.",
    "Sometimes, without food, a home, or a job prospect, a tired man might just lay down and ponder what lay ahead."
