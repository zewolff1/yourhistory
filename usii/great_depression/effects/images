    "This famous photograph is searing in its depiction of the utter desperation the Great Depression brought to so many and has become a symbol of the Depression. This woman was one of many migrant workers picking peas in California in the 1930s to make just enough money to survive.",
    "Hot and dry weather over several years brought dust storms that devastated the Great Plains states, known as the Dust Bowl.",
    "The drought, dust storms, and boll weevils that attacked Southern crops in the 1930s all worked together to destroy farms in the South.",
    "In 1929, before the stock market crash that marked the beginning of the Great Depression, the unemployment rate in the United States was 3.14%.",
    "At the beginning of the 1930s, many living in the South were tenant farmers, known as sharecroppers.",
    "Sharecroppers often found it difficult to earn enough money to feed their children.",
    "In the South, some children of sharecroppers were able to periodically attend school.",
    "While some men went out alone, others traveled with their entire families.",
    "Those fortunate enough to have a car would pack everything they could fit inside and head west.",
    "Having left their dying farms behind, these farmers are now migrants.",
    "Some migrant workers used their cars to expand their temporary shelters.",
    "Temporary housing came in many different forms.",
    "Migrant workers lived in their temporary shelters, cooking and washing there.",
    "Collections of temporary housing structures such as these are usually called shantytowns, but during the Great Depression, they were given the nickname \"Hoovervilles\" after President Herbert Hoover.",
    "Large cities were not immune to the hardships and struggles of the Great Depression.",
    "Sometimes, without food, a home, or a job prospect, a tired man might just lay down and ponder what lay ahead."
