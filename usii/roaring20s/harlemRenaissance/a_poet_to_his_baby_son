<h1>A Poet to His Baby Son</h1>
<h2>By James Weldon Johnson</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Tiny bit of humanity,</p>
<p>Blessed with your mother’s face,</p>
<p>And cursed with your father’s mind.</p>

<p>I say cursed with your father’s mind,</p>
<p>Because you can lie so long and so quietly on your back,</p>
<p>Playing with the dimpled big toe of your left foot,</p>
<p>And looking away,</p>
<p>Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond.</p>
<p>Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet?</p>

<p>Why don’t you kick and howl,</p>
<p>And make the neighbors talk about</p>
<p>“That damned baby next door,”</p>
<p>And make up your mind forthwith</p>
<p>To grow up and be a banker</p>
<p>Or a politician or some other sort of go-getter</p>
<p>Or—?—whatever you decide upon,</p>
<p>Rid yourself of these incipient thoughts</p>
<p>About being a poet.</p>

<p>For poets no longer are makers of songs,</p>
<p>Chanters of the gold and purple harvest,</p>
<p>Sayers of the glories of earth and sky,</p>
<p>Of the sweet pain of love</p>
<p>And the keen joy of living;</p>
<p>No longer dreamers of the essential dreams,</p>
<p>And interpreters of the eternal truth,</p>
<p>Through the eternal beauty.</p>
<p>Poets these days are unfortunate fellows.</p>
<p>Baffled in trying to say old things in a new way</p>
<p>Or new things in an old language,</p>
<p>They talk abracadabra</p>
<p>In an unknown tongue,</p>
<p>Each one fashioning for himself</p>
<p>A wordy world of shadow problems,</p>
<p>And as a self-imagined Atlas,</p>
<p>Struggling under it with puny legs and arms,</p>
<p>Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load.</p>

<p>My son, this is no time nor place for a poet;</p>
<p>Grow up and join the big, busy crowd</p>
<p>That scrambles for what it thinks it wants</p>
<p>Out of this old world which is—as it is—</p>
<p>And, probably, always will be.</p>

<p>Take the advice of a father who knows:</p>
<p>You cannot begin too young</p>
<p>Not to be a poet.</p>
</blockquote>
