<h1>America</h1>
<h2>By Claude McKay</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,</p>
<p>And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,</p>
<p>Stealing my breath of life, I will confess</p>
<p>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth.</p>

<p>Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,</p>
<p>Giving me strength erect against her hate,</p>
<p>Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.</p>
<p>Yet, as a rebel fronts a king in state,</p>

<p>I stand within her walls with not a shred</p>
<p>Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.</p>
<p>Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,</p>
<p>And see her might and granite wonders there,</p>

<p>Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,</p>
<p>Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.</p>
