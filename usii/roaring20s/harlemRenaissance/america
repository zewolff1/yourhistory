<h1>America</h1>
<h2>By Claude McKay</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,<br>
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,<br>
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess<br>
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth.</p>

<p>Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,<br>
Giving me strength erect against her hate,<br>
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.<br>
Yet, as a rebel fronts a king in state,</p>

<p>I stand within her walls with not a shred<br>
Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.<br>
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,<br>
And see her might and granite wonders there,</p>

<p>Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,<br>
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.</p>
</blockquote>
