<p>The following list contains some of the provisions that Hitler proposed at the National Socialist German Workers' Party&rsquo;s first large party gathering in February 1920.</p>
<ol>
<li>We demand the unification of all Germans in a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of national self-determination.</li>
<li>We demand . . . the revocation of the peace treaty of Versailles . . .</li>
<li>We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population.</li>
<li>. . . Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.</li>
<li>Non-citizens may only live in Germany as guests and must be subject to laws for aliens.</li>
<li>The right to vote. . . shall be enjoyed by the citizens . . . alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, whether in the Reich, in the states or in the smaller localities, shall be held by none but citizens.</li>
<li>We demand that the State shall make its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens. If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported . . .</li>
<li>All non-German immigration must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who entered Germany after 2 November 1914 shall be required to leave immediately . . .</li>
<li>. . . To facilitate the creation of a German national press we demand:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>that all editors of, and contributors to newspapers appearing in the German language must be members of the nation;</li>
<li>that no non-German newspapers may appear without express permission of the State. They must not be printed in the German language;</li>
<li>that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers . . .</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The Party . . . is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle: The common interest before self-interest . .&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
