<div class="standard-hero__summary">Reflect on these firsthand experiences of former members of the Nazi Youth.</div>
<div class="standard-hero__summary">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="standard-hero__summary">In his book&nbsp;<em>Mein Kampf</em>, written in the 1920s, Hitler said, &ldquo;Whoever has the youth has the future.&rdquo; Even before they came to power in 1933, Nazi leaders had begun to organize groups that would train young people according to Nazi principles. By 1936, all &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; children in Germany over the age of six were required to join a Nazi youth group. At ten, boys were initiated into the&nbsp;<em>Jungvolk</em>&nbsp;(Young People), and at 14 they were promoted to the Hitler Youth. Their sisters joined the&nbsp;<em>Jungm&auml;del&nbsp;</em>(Young Girls) and were later promoted to the League of German Girls. Hitler hoped that &ldquo;These young people will learn nothing else but how to think German and act German. . . . And they will never be free again, not in their whole lives."</div>

<p>Although membership in the Hitler Youth organizations was compulsory, many young people did not have to be forced to join. In fact, they were eager to do so, drawn by the sense of belonging and importance they felt as members of these groups. In 1938, a boy named Hans Wolf wrote a story about his experiences in the Hitler Youth that was published in a school textbook. The story was called &ldquo;Comradeship.&rdquo; It begins:</p>
<blockquote>It was a hot day and we had far to march. The sun was burning down on the heath, which was bereft of trees. The sand was glistening, I was tired. My feet were hurting in those new walking shoes, every step was hurting and all I could think about was rest, water, and shade. I clenched my teeth to keep walking. I was the youngest, and this was my first outing. In front of me strode Rudolf, the leader. He was tall and strong. His backpack was heavy and pressed down on his shoulders. Rudolf carried the bread for us six boys, the cooking pot, and a pile of books, from which he would read us wonderfully thrilling stories, at night in the hostel. My backpack only contained a shirt, a couple of sneakers, washing utensils, and some cooking gear, apart from a tarpaulin for rainy days and straw beds. And yet I thought I could not lug this backpack any longer. My comrades all were somewhat older and had camping experience. They hardly felt the heat and hardship of the march. Every now and then they would sigh and drink lukewarm coffee from their canteens. More and more, I remained behind, even though I tried to make up for my slack by running. Suddenly Rudolf turned around. He stopped and watched me crawling up to him from a distance, while our comrades continued in the direction of a few trees on the horizon. &ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; Rudolf asked me, kindly. Ashamed, I had to say yes. Slowly, we walked side by side. I was limping. But I did not want to let on to Rudolf. When we got to a juniper bush, the leader sat down and said: &ldquo;For a little rest!&rdquo; Relieved, I threw myself down. I did not want to talk, for I was shy. Rudolf gave me something to drink. I thanked him and leaned back comfortably, glad to be able to stretch my aching feet, and before I knew it I was sleeping. . . . When we resumed our march, my feet hurt much less and my backpack did not press down on me so. I was very glad about that.</blockquote>
