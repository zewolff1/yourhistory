<h2 data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">The Impact of the Nuremberg Laws</h2>
<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">The Nuremberg Laws turned Jews from German citizens into &ldquo;residents of Germany.&rdquo; Technically, the law made intermarriage between Jews and German citizens a criminal offense, but existing marriages were not dissolved or criminalized, perhaps in order to maintain public support.</p>
<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">The laws transformed the lives of Jews all over Germany, including thousands of people who had not previously known their families had Jewish heritage. Among them were Marianne Schweitzer and her siblings.&nbsp;</p>
