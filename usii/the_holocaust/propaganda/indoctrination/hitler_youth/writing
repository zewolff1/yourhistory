<p>In his book <em>Mein Kampf</em>, written in the 1920s, Hitler said, <blockquote>“Whoever has the youth has the future.”</blockquote> Even before they came to power in 1933, Nazi leaders had begun to organize groups that would train young people according to Nazi principles. By 1936, all “Aryan” children in Germany over the age of six were required to join a Nazi youth group. At ten, boys were initiated into the <em>Jungvolk</em> (Young People), and at 14 they were promoted to the Hitler Youth. Their sisters joined the <em>Jungmädel</em> (Young Girls) and were later promoted to the League of German Girls. Hitler hoped that <blockquote>“These young people will learn nothing else but how to think German and act German. . . . And they will never be free again, not in their whole lives.”</blockquote></p>
