<h2>Adolf Hitler</h2>
<p>After World War I, Germany was in chaos. Its new government, called the Weimar Republic had signed the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty had blamed the war on Germany, redistributed German land, banned the German military and forced Germany to pay massive amounts of reparations (payments made for war). When the Great Depression Germans demanded a government that could provide jobs and rebuild German pride. The man who sought to deliver that government was Adolf Hitler. Hitler had watched Mussolini rise to power and wanted to imitate his actions. Hitler restored German pride by proclaiming that Germans belonged to a superior, “Aryan” race. He blamed much of Germany’s problems on one percent of the German population, the Jews.</p>
<p>Hitler won power in Germany’s democratic government in 1933 through his political party, the National Socialist German Workers or Nazi, party. Like Mussolini, Hitler was a dictator. Once in power, he banned all other political parties and had his opponents arrested or killed. Hitler’s elite, black uniformed unit called the SS arrested and murdered hundreds of Hitler’s enemies. Their brutal actions and the terror created by the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, scared most Germans into total obedience of Hitler. The Nazis also passed laws depriving Jews of most of their rights. Simultaneously, Hitler began his mission of finding more lebensraum, or German living space. Hitler maintained that Germany was overcrowded and needed more land to accommodate his superior race. Most Germans accepted the loss of freedoms. They did not question Nazi racism. They let Hitler blame troubles on the Jews. They even welcomed his military buildup, an act outlawed by the Versailles treaty.</p>
