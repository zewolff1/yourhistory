<h2>Benito Mussolini</h2>
<p>Many people including Benito Mussolini, a newspaper editor and politician, was upset with the outcome of World War I. The Paris Peace Treaties gave away lands the Italians had expected to control. Many war veterans could not find jobs. Economic problems led to workers strikes, riots and fear. The government seemed powerless. In 1919, Mussolini organized the Fascist Party. He promised if Italians united behind him, he would restore the country to the greatness of the ancient Roman Empire. By 1925, the Fascists had used violence and terror to gain control. They imprisoned and killed those who were against them. They ended free elections, free speech, and the free press.</p>
<p>When the Great Depression struck, Mussolini distracted his citizens by invading Ethiopia in North Africa. Ethiopia took their protests to the League of Nations, but the League did nothing. Mussolini took over Ethiopia.</p>
