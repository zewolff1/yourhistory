<p>As the Nazis eliminated civil liberties in Germany and opened the first concentration camps to imprison enemies of the state; they were also trying to win public approval for their government. According to historian Robert Gellately,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hitler and his henchmen did not want to cower the German people as a whole into submission, but to win them over by building on popular images, cherished ideals, and long held phobias in the country. . . . [The Nazis] aimed to create and maintain the broadest possible level of popular backing. They expended an enormous amount of energy and resources to track public opinion and to win over people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda played a key role in the Nazis; efforts to cultivate favorable public opinion. <em>Propaganda</em> is biased or misleading information that is used to influence public opinion. Hitler created the new ministry on March 13, 1933, and put Joseph Goebbels in charge. It was his job not just to present the regime and its policies in a positive light, but to generate the impression that the entire German people enthusiastically endorsed everything it did.</p>
<p>To generate excitement and enthusiasm for the Nazi Party and for Hitler himself, Goebbels and his ministry created new festivals and holidays, such as the celebration of Hitler's birthday on April 20. They changed street names and other public signage to erase reminders of the Weimar Republic. They organized party rallies and dramatic torch-lit parades to demonstrate public support.</p>
