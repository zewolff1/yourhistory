<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">From the start, Adolf Hitler and his fellow Nazis were determined to resolve the so-called &ldquo;Jewish question.&rdquo; In Hitler&rsquo;s words, Nazi leaders were to bring it up &ldquo;again and again and again, unceasingly. Every emotional aversion, however slight, must be exploited ruthlessly.&rdquo; Julius Streicher, the publisher of an antisemitic newspaper known as&nbsp;<em data-pf_style_display="inline" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">Der St&uuml;rmer</em>&nbsp;(the word means &ldquo;attacker&rdquo;), led the way in creating that kind of propaganda, claiming:</p>
<blockquote data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">
<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">The same Jew who plunged the German people into the bloodletting of the World War, and who committed on it the crime of the November Revolution [Weimar Republic] is now engaged in stabbing Germany, recovering from its shame and misery, in the back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Jew is again engaged in poisoning public opinion.</p>

</blockquote>
<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">Propaganda was not the only weapon the Nazis used against the Jews. They also relied on terror. On March 9, 1933, just a few days after the elections, Nazi SA storm troopers in Berlin imprisoned dozens of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. In Breslau, they attacked Jewish lawyers and judges. On March 13 in Mannheim, they forced Jewish shopkeepers to close their doors. In other towns, they broke into Jewish homes and beat up the people living there.</p>
<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">Although these events were rarely reported in the German press, the foreign press wrote about them regularly. In the United States, many Jews and non-Jews were outraged by the violence. Some called for a boycott of German goods. Their outburst gave the Nazis an excuse for a &ldquo;defensive action against the Jewish world criminal&rdquo; on April 1, 1933.</p>
<p data-pf_style_display="block" data-pf_style_visibility="visible">That action&mdash;a boycott of Jewish-owned businesses&mdash;was the first major public event that specifically targeted Jews not as Communists or Social Democrats but as Jews. It was not a huge success. In some places, Germans showed their disapproval of the boycott by making a point of shopping at Jewish-owned stores on April 1.</p>
