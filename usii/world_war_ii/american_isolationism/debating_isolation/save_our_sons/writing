<p>Numerous groups advocated against American involvement in World War II. Some, like the National Council for the Prevention of War (founded in 1921 to promote neutrality) and Keep America Out of War Congress (founded in 1938 to oppose Roosevelt’s foreign policy), predated the war. Others united multiple constituencies after the war began to lobby more effectively. Mothers who did not wish to send their sons to war, Americans of German or Italian descent, Americans of Irish descent (who opposed helping Great Britain), socialists, students, pacifists, and a host of prominent businessmen, intellectuals, and average citizens took action to prevent US intervention. Though more Republicans than Democrats advocated non-intervention, these groups were not split along partisan lines. Many antiwar advocates did not appreciate the term “isolationist” commonly used to describe them. They often argued for a strong national defense and broad economic spheres of influence, even as they tried to persuade the United States to stay out of the war.</p>

<p>The largest and most influential non-interventionist group was the America First Committee, founded in September 1940 by a group of Yale University law students. The students, led by R. Douglas Stuart Jr., gathered prominent Americans to serve on the organization’s board, including: the president of the American Olympic Committee Avery Brundage; Hormel Foods chief executive Jay Hormel; Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford; late President Theodore Roosevelt’s daughter Alice Roosevelt Longworth; and General Hugh Johnson, who had been the director of the National Recovery Act, one of President Franklin Roosevelt’s early New Deal programs. Democratic senator Burton Wheeler (Montana), and Republican senators Gerald Nye (North Dakota) and Robert Taft (Ohio) also served as important spokesmen for the organization.</p>
