<p>In December 1940, Churchill informed Roosevelt that Britain would soon run out of cash to pay for transporting necessary war supplies. In response, Roosevelt told Americans during a fireside chat on December 29 that the United States “must be the great arsenal of democracy,” putting every effort towards manufacturing planes, ships, guns, and ammunition for Great Britain. “The sole purpose” of supplying Great Britain, he reassured them, “is to keep war away from our country and our people.” But by the time FDR began his third term in 1941, fewer Americans believed the United States would be able to keep out of war.</p>

<p>In January 1941, Roosevelt’s Congressional allies introduced HR 1776, a bill which granted the president the power to “sell, transfer title to, exchange, lend, lease, or otherwise dispose of...any defense article” to another country. America First Committee members referred to HR 1776 as the “War Dictatorship Bill,” but most Americans knew it as “Lend-Lease” for short. Polls showed that 68% of Americans approved of the lend-lease proposal. However, the Chicago chapter of the America First Committee claimed to have collected 700,000 signatures and 328,000 protest telephone calls in opposition of “the dictator bill." Despite the efforts of non-interventionists, the bill passed easily, and Roosevelt signed Lend-Lease into law on March 11, 1941.</p>
