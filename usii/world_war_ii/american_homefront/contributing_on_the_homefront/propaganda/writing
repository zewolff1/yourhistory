<h2>What are common types of propaganda?</h2>

<h3>Name-calling</h3>
<p>
The name-calling technique is very literal. Propaganda that utilizes this technique uses insults to call out the perceived deficits of the competition or the opposing side. This name-calling can resort to the use of stereotypes and slurs.
</p>

<h3>Glittering generalities</h3>
<p>
Glittering generalities are empty words or words that make people or products sound better than they are with vague, often unprovable statements. This technique is especially used in political campaigns when politicians are described as “refreshing” or “decent” — descriptors that are complimentary, subjective, and ultimately meaningless.
</p>

<h3>Transfer</h3>
<p>
The technique of transfer involves transferring the positive or negative value of something onto a person, product, or cause by association. For example, a business owner could seem more trustworthy or respectable because they stand in front of an American flag in their commercial.
</p>

<h3>Testimonial</h3>
<p>
Testimonials are the endorsement by a celebrity or generally respected person for a product, person, or cause. This technique is commonly used as a persuasive device in advertising — say you are looking to find a high-quality toothpaste, and four out of five dentists recommend a specific brand. You would be more likely to spend money on that brand because someone who ostensibly knows more than you about that product tells you to use it.
</p>

<h3>Plain-folk</h3>
<p>
The technique of plain-folk takes the concept of “real people” and uses it as an aspirational tool. It seeks to convince an audience that a certain product is perfect for the average person, or that a politician is a regular Joe — just like them. Plain-folk makes “lowest common denominator” a compliment rather than an insult.
</p>

<h3>Card-stacking</h3>
<p>
Card-stacking is a way of listing all of the features or aspects of a product, person, or cause that stresses the positive qualities while downplaying the negative or questionable qualities. The intention is to give the audience only a small part of the picture.
</p>

<h3>Bandwagon</h3>
<p>
The bandwagon technique encourages people to join up with others or take part in something because everyone else is doing it — without critically thinking about why they would involve themselves. It additionally plays on our fear of missing out on something others are enjoying.
