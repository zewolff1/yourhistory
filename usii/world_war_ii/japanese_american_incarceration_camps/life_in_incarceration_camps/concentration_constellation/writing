<p>“Concentration Constellation” by Lawson Fusao Inada<br>
In this poem, Lawson Fusao Inada, a survivor of Japanese American incarceration during World War II, describes the prison camps across the United States.<br>
In this earthly configuration,</p>

<p>we have, not points of light,</p>

<p>but prominent barbs of dark.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s all right there on the map.</p>

<p>It’s all right there in the mind.</p>

<p>Find it. If you care to look.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Begin between the Golden State’s</p>

<p>highest and lowest elevations</p>

<p>and name that location</p>

<p></p>

<p>Manzanar. Rattlesnake a line</p>

<p>southward to the zone</p>

<p>of Arizona, to the home</p>

<p>of natives on the reservation,</p>

<p>and call those Gila, Poston.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then just take your time</p>

<p>winding your way across</p>

<p>the Southwest expanse, the Lone</p>

<p>Star State of Texas, gather</p>

<p>up a mess of blues as you</p>

<p>meander around the banks</p>

<p>of the humid Mississippi; yes,</p>

<p>just make yourself at home.</p>

<p>in the swamps of Arkansas,</p>

<p>for this is Rohwer and Jerome.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By now, you weary of the way.</p>

<p>It’s a big country, you say.</p>

<p>It’s a big history, hardly</p>

<p>halfway through—with Amache</p>

<p>looming in the Colorado desert,</p>

<p>Heart Mountain high in wide</p>

<p></p>

<p>Wyoming, Minidoka on the moon</p>

<p>of Idaho, then down to Utah’s</p>

<p>jewel of Topaz before finding</p>

<p>yourself at northern California’s</p>

<p>frozen shore of Tule Lake . . .</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now regard what sort of shape</p>

<p>this constellation takes.</p>

<p>It sits there like a jagged scar,</p>

<p>massive, on the massive landscape.</p>

<p>It lies there like the rusted wire</p>

<p>of a twisted and remembered fence.</p>
