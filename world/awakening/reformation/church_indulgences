<h2>What are Indulgences?</h2>
<p>An indulgence is a remission of the punishment of sin. Absolution alone, granted by a priest, is not enough to wipe the slate clean; a person is temporally punished for the sins accumulated in life, so an indulgence is a way to reduce that. In essence, it is getting time off for good behaviour.</p>
<p>Indulgences can be anything from good works and charitable acts to prayer and pilgrimage. During medieval times, however, they were abused and corrupted into a moneymaking enterprise. Throughout the 11th and 12th centuries, the Christian belief in purgatory – the place in between heaven and hell where souls are purified through punishment – grew and intensified. Believers wanted to avoid ending up there at any cost.</p>
<h2>Why Was It A Problem?</h2>
<p>As more indulgences were granted, a complex system evolved whereby the church could calculate exactly how much time off purgatory each one was worth. The more time, the bigger the indulgence. There was no limit to what could be granted thanks to the ‘treasury of merit’, a spiritual bank where the good works and merits of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, Christ’s faithful and the saints are collected and can be drawn upon for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>The problem was money. Instead of people earning indulgences through Christian devotion, it became clear that they could be exchanged for a payment. This might be a donation to a charitable cause or, for the wealthy, to have church buildings erected. The bottom line: if you gave the church money, you would be awarded salvation. Such a purchase even came with a receipt, or letter of indulgence. Eventually, it became possible to secure indulgences for someone already dead.</p>
