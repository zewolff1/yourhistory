<h2>Excerpts from Martin Luther’s 95 Theses</h2>
<p>Martin Luther</p>
<p>1517</p>
<p>Note: Martin Luther was a Catholic priest who was unhappy with his church. On October 31, 1517 he posted his 95 Theses , or criticisms, on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany. One of his goals was to stir up debate about indulgences. Indulgences were payments to the Roman Catholic Church in return for pardons for one’s sins and grants of salvation in the afterlife. Because of the printing press, the 95 Theses were known throughout Germany in two weeks and throughout Europe in a month. Luther’s protest triggered a movement called the Protestant Reformation and led to the development of the Lutheran religion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus those indulgence preachers are in error who say that a man is absolved [pardoned] from every penalty and saved by papal indulgences.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>They preach only human doctrines who say that as soon as the money clinks into the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Those who believe that they can be certain of their salvation because they have indulgence letters will be eternally damned, together with their teachers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As Rome prepared the heavy artillery, Luther fired off more salvos [shots], with the help of the press. His sermons, tracts and polemics [political attacks], all in German … streamed from presses by the hundreds of thousands…. According to one estimate, a third of all books printed in Germany between 1518 and 1525 were by him. Pause to consider that figure. Of course, printing was in its infancy, but Germany at the time was turning out about a million books a year, of which a third – 300,000 – were by Luther.</p></blockquote>
