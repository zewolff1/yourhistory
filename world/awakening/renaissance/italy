<h2>
What was Italy Like?
</h2>
<p>
Italy in the 1400s was unlike any other place in Europe. It was divided into independent city-states, each with a different form of government. Florence, where the Italian Renaissance began, was an independent republic. It was also a banking and commercial capital and the third-largest city in Europe. Wealthy Florentines flaunted their money and power by becoming patrons who funded the work of artists and intellectuals. In this way, the city became the cultural center of Europe, and of the Renaissance.
