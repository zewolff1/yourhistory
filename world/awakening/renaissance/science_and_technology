Science and Technology</h2>

Humanism encouraged people to be curious and to question received wisdom, particularly that of the Catholic Church. It also encouraged people to use experimentation and observation to solve earthly problems. As a result, many Renaissance intellectuals focused on trying to define and understand the laws of nature and the physical world.

For example, Renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci created detailed scientific studies of objects ranging from flying machines to submarines. He also carried out pioneering studies of human anatomy. The scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei investigated one natural law after another. By dropping different-sized cannonballs from the top of a building, he proved that all objects fall at the same rate of acceleration.

Galileo also built a powerful telescope. He used it to show that Earth and other planets revolved around the sun and not, as religious authorities argued, the other way around. For this, Galileo was arrested and threatened with torture and death, but he refused to deny what he knew to be true. "I do not believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use," he said.

Perhaps the most important technological development of the Renaissance took place in Germany. In the middle of the 1400s, Johannes Gutenberg invented the mechanical movable-type printing press. For the first time, it was possible to make books – and, by extension, knowledge – widely available.
