What was the Renaissance?
</h2>
<p>
Toward the end of the 1300s, a handful of Italian thinkers declared that they were living in a new age. The barbarous [uncivilized], unenlightened "Middle Ages" were over. The new age would be a "rinascita," or rebirth, of learning and literature, art and culture. This was the birth of the period now known as the Renaissance.

For centuries, scholars agreed that the Italian Renaissance, which also means rebirth, began that simply: that between the 1300s and the 1600s, a new, modern way of thinking about the world and man's place in it replaced an old, backward one.

In fact, the Renaissance in Italy and in other parts of Europe was considerably more complicated than that. In many ways, the period we call the Renaissance was not so different from the era that preceded it. However, many of the scientific, artistic and cultural achievements of the Renaissance do share common themes – most notably the humanistic belief that man was the center of his own universe.
