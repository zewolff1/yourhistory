<h2>
Humanism</h2>
<p>
Thanks to the patronage [money and support] of these wealthy elites, Renaissance-era writers and thinkers no longer had to work at ordinary jobs or join a monastery. Instead, they could enjoy worldly pleasures. They traveled around Italy, studying ancient ruins and rediscovering Greek and Roman texts. To Renaissance scholars and philosophers, these classical sources held great wisdom. Their nonreligious nature, their appreciation of physical beauty and especially their emphasis on man's own achievements formed the principle of the Italian Renaissance. This philosophy is known as "humanism."
