<h2>Estates General</h2>
<p>To garner support for these measures and forestall a growing aristocratic revolt, the king summoned the Estates General (les états généraux)—an assembly representing France’s clergy, nobility and middle class—for the first time since 1614.</p>
<p>The meeting was scheduled for May 5, 1789; in the meantime, delegates of the three estates from each locality would compile lists of grievances (cahiers de doléances) to present to the king.</p>
