<h2>Self-Evident Truths</h2>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2.1 that all men are created equal</p>
  <p>2.2 that they [men] are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</p>
  <p>2.3 that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
  <p>2.4 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed</p>
  <p>2.5 That whenever any Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it [the government], and to start a new Government, laying its foundation on such principles that shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness.</p>
