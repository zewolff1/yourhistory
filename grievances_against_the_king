<h2>Grievances Against the King</h2>
<p>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3.1 He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>
  <p>3.2 He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
  <p>3.3 He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>
  <p>3.4 He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p>
  <p>3.5 For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
  <p>3.6 For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>
  <p>3.7 For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>
  <p>3.8 For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>
  <p>3.9 For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>
  <p>3.10 For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
  <p>3.11 For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>
  <p>3.12 He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>
  <p>3.13 He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>
  <p>3.14 He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>
