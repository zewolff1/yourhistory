<p>In 1845, John O'Sullivan, a New Yorker and editor of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;Away, away with all these cobweb tissues of rights of discovery, exploration, settlement, contiguity, etc. The American claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federative self-government entrusted to us. It is a right such as that of the tree to the space of air and earth suitable for the full expansion of its principle and destiny of growth. ...It is in our future far more than in the past history of Spanish exploration or French colonial rights, that our True Title is to be found.&quot;</p>
