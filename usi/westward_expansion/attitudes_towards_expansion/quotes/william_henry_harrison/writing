<p>Governor William Henry Harrison, of the Indiana Territory (1800-1812) while defending displacement of the Indians</p>

<p>“Is one of the fairest portions of the globe to remain in a state of nature, the haunt of a few wretched savages, when it seems destined by the Creator to give support to a large population and to be the seat of civilization?”</p>
