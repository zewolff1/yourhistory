<p>The Monroe Doctrine, first outlined in a speech by President James Monroe to Congress in 1823, warned European powers not to not attempt further colonization, military intervention or other interference in the Western Hemisphere, stating that the United States would view any such interference as a potentially hostile act. Over the centuries, the Monroe Doctrine has become a cornerstone of U.S. diplomatic and military policy.</p>

<p>By the early 1820s, many Latin American countries had won their independence from Spain or Portugal, with the U.S. government recognizing the new republics of Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico in 1822.</p>

<p>Yet both Britain and the United States worried that the powers of continental Europe would make future attempts to restore colonial regimes in the region. Russia had also inspired concerns of imperialism, with Czar Alexander I claiming sovereignty over territory in the Pacific Northwest and banning foreign ships from approaching that coast in 1821.</p>

<p>Though Monroe had initially supported the idea of a joint U.S.-British resolution against future colonization in Latin America, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams argued that joining forces with the British could limit future U.S. opportunities for expansion and that Britain might well have imperialist ambitions of its own.</p>

<p>Adams convinced Monroe to make a unilateral statement of U.S. policy that would set an independent course for the young nation and assert a new role as protector of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
