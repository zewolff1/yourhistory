<p>It was yet another innovation in transportation, the steam-powered locomotive, that ultimately had the furthest-reaching impact. Trains were a heavy-duty, fast, year-round transport solution, and in time they became the preferred option for commercial shipping. The earliest U.S. railroads covered only short distances, providing portage between two waterways. In 1827, a group of Baltimore, Maryland, businessmen formed a chartered corporation to build the first major railway between their city and the Ohio River. Many more private railway enterprises followed in the decades prior to the Civil War. Between 1840 and 1860, the nation saw a ten-fold increase in the amount of track laid, from 4,828 to 48,280 kilometers (3,000 to 30,000 miles). The majority of this development was in the northern states. Because competing companies built railways, the different lines used different rail gauges and track widths and were not interoperable until rails were standardized years later. The first transcontinental line was established in 1869 when the Central Pacific and Union Pacific lines met. Once their infrastructure was completed and initial problems resolved, the railways lowered the cost of transporting many kinds of goods. Railroads became a major industry, stimulating other heavy industries such as iron and steel production.</p>
