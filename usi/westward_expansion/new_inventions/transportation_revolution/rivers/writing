<p>Meanwhile, river transport was aided immensely by the application of steam power. While American engineer Robert Fulton did not invent the steamboat, he was the first to make an unqualified success with the technology. In 1807, his paddle-wheeled vessel, the Clermont, achieved the astonishing speed of eight kilometers per hour (five miles per hour) on its first voyage up the Hudson River from New York City, New York, to Albany, New York. Steamboats made two-way river traffic a viable proposition—and they could haul a large amount of freight. Before long there were dozens of them, then hundreds, steaming along the Mississippi River and other major rivers.</p>

<p>Canals gave the maritime transportation system still greater reach. The largest and most important was New York’s Erie Canal, approved by the state legislature in 1817 and completed eight years later. Extending from Buffalo to Albany at a width of 12.1 meters (40 feet) and a depth of 1.2 meters (four feet), this mighty engineering feat created an artificial waterway connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River, which empties into the Atlantic. The Erie Canal drastically reduced both the travel time and the cost of shipping commodities such as grain and lumber from the Midwest to the eastern seaboard. It led to an immediate and dramatic increase in the shipment of such goods, and the state’s investment in the monumental project paid off handsomely. Incoming toll revenues surpassed the entire cost of the canal’s construction within 12 years. By the 1840s, New York City had become the nation’s leading commercial port and well established as the country’s financial and trade capital. The rest of the state of New York—especially cities along the canal route, such as Rochester and Syracuse—also prospered.<br>
