<h2>War Between France and Britain</h2>
<p>On April 22, 1793, President George Washington issued a Neutrality Proclamation to define the policy of the United States in response to warfare in Europe, including the French Revolution. The Proclamation stated, “that they [the United States] should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent Powers.”1 The Proclamation warned Americans that the federal government would prosecute any violations of this policy by its citizens, and would not protect them should they be tried by a belligerent nation. Washington feared the United States could be pulled into a foreign war, and any allegiance to a particular nation at war could adversely affect the economy.</p>
<p>This statement of policy triggered a fierce reaction from those who considered it a sellout of the nation’s revolutionary impulses for the financial gain of the merchant class. “The cause of France is the cause of man, and neutrality is desertion,” one anonymous correspondent wrote the president.2 Critics believed that the Proclamation marked a betrayal of our oldest ally. The Proclamation was important for presidential precedent as it established in the exertion of executive authority in the realm of foreign policy. Differing opinions on the policy excited partisan passions that were formative to the creation of political parties in the first party system.</p>
