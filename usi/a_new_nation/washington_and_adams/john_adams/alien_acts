<h2>Alien Acts</h2>
<p>In 1798, the Federalist dominated Congress, in conjunction with the Adams administration began drafting a set of four laws. These included the Naturalization Act, that extended the residency requirement for immigrants to become citizens from 5 to 14 years. Federalists justified it to ensure that new citizens had sufficient time to adopt American values. However, it was widely viewed as a tool to limit the influence of immigrants, many of whom supported the Democratic-Republicans.</p>
<p>Secondly the Alien Friends Act authorized the president to deport any non-citizen deemed dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States. The broad and vague language gave the executive branch broad authority. Next the Alien Enemies Act allowed the president during war time to detain or deport male citizens of a hostile nation.</p>
