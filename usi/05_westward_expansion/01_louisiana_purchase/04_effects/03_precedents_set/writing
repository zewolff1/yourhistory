<p>The Louisiana Purchase remains one of the boldest land deals in history. It doubled the size of the United States, secured its western frontier, and ensured its control of a vital river system. It also set precedents: that presidents could acquire territory through treaty, that America’s destiny was continental, and that expansion carried both promise and peril.</p>
<p>For Jefferson, who once doubted its constitutionality, the purchase became a crowning achievement of his presidency. For Indigenous nations, however, it marked the beginning of greater displacement as American settlers pressed westward.</p>
<p>In 1803, the United States was still a fragile experiment in self-government. In Paris, a single pen stroke transformed the United States into a continental power. The Louisiana Purchase was not just a land transaction; it was a transformation of national identity.</p>
